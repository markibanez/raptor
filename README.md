# raptor
The next generation micro-blogging service powered by Web3

## What is Raptor?
It is the decentralized, web3 version of Twitter.

## Architecture
- Probably use Polygon (low gas fees!)
- ~~IPFS storage for front-end (Fleek.app)~~
    - Fleek.app will only serve static files so this won't work
- We will use vercel for the frontend and api backend
